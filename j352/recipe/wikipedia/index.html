<img src="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:San_Francisco_49ers_logo.svg" alt="">

<P>The San Francisco 49ers are a professional American football team based in the San Francisco Bay Area. The 49ers
    compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member of the league's National Football Conference (NFC) West
    division, and play their home games at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California, located 38 miles (61 km) southeast
    of San Francisco. The team is named after the prospectors who arrived in Northern California in the 1849 Gold Rush.
</P>

<h2>Franchise History</h2>
<P> The San Francisco 49ers, an original member of the new All-America Football Conference (AAFC), were the first major
    league professional sports franchise based in San Francisco, and one of the first major league professional sports
    teams based on the Pacific Coast.In 1946, the team joined the Los Angeles Dons of the AAFC and the Los Angeles Rams
    of the rival National Football League as the first three teams playing a "big four"-sport in the Western United
    States,eventually becoming part of the NFL themselves in 1950.</P>

<h3>Championships</h3>
<P>The 49ers have won five Super Bowls, their first three under Bill Walsh. Walsh retired after winning his third in
    1988, but first-year head coach George Seifert did not miss a beat, winning the Super Bowl in his first year in
    1989. He would also win one more in 1994</P>

<h3>Rivlaries</h3>

<p>The San Francisco 49ers have three rivals within their division: the Los Angeles Rams, the Arizona Cardinals, and the
    Seattle Seahawks. They also have rivalries with other teams that arose from post-season games in the past, most
    notably the Dallas Cowboys, New York Giants, and Green Bay Packers. They also share an intrastate rivalry with the
    Los Angeles Chargers (the two teams have played each other nearly every preseason, and every four years in the
    regular season, and also met in Super Bowl XXIX).</p>

<h4>Culture</h4>
<P>The 49ers official cheerleading squad is called the Gold Rush. Started in the early 1980s, the first squad consisted
    of 14 dancers.</P>
<P>In November 2018, shortly before the start of a game against the Oakland Raiders, a cheerleader for the San Francisco
    49ers appeared to kneel during the US national anthem, becoming the first NFL cheerleader to do so. The act of
    kneeling during the national anthem began with the quarterback Colin Kaepernick to raise awareness about racism and
    police brutality.</P>
