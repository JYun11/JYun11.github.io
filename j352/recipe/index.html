    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>Ravioli with mushrooms and cream. A savory light cream sauce enhanced by a medley of mushrooms. I love mushrooms
        and with the opportunity given to cook with them, I jump on it. A quick dinner of ravioli.</p>
    <br> Here I have selected lobster ravioli for our dinner, however, any kind of your choosing will work beautifully
    as well, placed on a soup bowl and covered with a heavy cream reduced with chicken stock and combined with very
    simple gently cooked mushrooms with butter, lemon juice, and the natural juices of the mushrooms rendered during
    cooking. Simplicity at its best. Flavors out of this world<br>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <p>½ pound mixed mushrooms, Baby Bella and Chanterelle, cleaned, bottom trimmed and quartered</p>
    <p>1 ¾ cup chicken stock</p>
    <p>1 ¾ cup heavy cream</p>
    <p>1 tablespoon unsalted butter</p>
    <p>½ lemon squeezed</p>
    <p>1 pound lobster tail</p>
    <P> parsley or chives for garnish (optional) </P>

    <h4>Preparation</h4>
    <p> 1. In a saucepan combine the chicken stock and the heavy cream and reduce by half over medium-high heat, 30 to
        35 minutes.</p>
    <p> 2. In a saucepan, add the lemon juice, butter, and mushrooms. Cover and cook over medium heat until the
        mushrooms are tender, 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. </p>
    <p> 3. Add the reduced cream mixture and stir to coat the mushrooms. Keep warm at very low heat.</p>
    <p> 4. Cook your ravioli in a large, salted pasta pot according to manufacture directions. Drain.</p>
    <p> 5. In 4 shallow pasta bowls arrange half of the mushrooms and cream sauce. Place the ravioli on each plate and
        cover with the remaining mushrooms and cream. </p>
    <p> 6. Garnish with parsley or chives </p>
